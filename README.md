# Discord Bot to interact with Crafty Controller api

So far all it does is start the server.

requires discord.js and some other stuff

you need a .env file and it needs to have all your secret stuff but I forgot what it was again so idk maybe I'll update this to be more helpful if I ever get to doing it.
